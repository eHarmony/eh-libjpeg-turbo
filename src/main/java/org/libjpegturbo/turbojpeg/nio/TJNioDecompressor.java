     *            buffer that will receive the decompressed/decoded image. If the source image is a JPEG image, then
     *            this buffer should normally be <code>pitch * scaledHeight</code> bytes in size, where
     *            <code>scaledHeight</code> can be determined by calling <code>

     * </code> with one of the scaling factors returned from {@link TJ#getScalingFactors} or by calling
     *            {@link #getScaledHeight}. If the source image is a YUV image, then this buffer should normally be
     *            <code>pitch * height</code> bytes in size, where <code>height</code> is the height of the YUV image.
     *            However, the buffer may also be larger than the dimensions of the source image, in which case the
     *            <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>pitch</code> parameters can be used to specify the region
     *            into which the source image should be decompressed/decoded.
     *
     * @param x
     *            x offset (in pixels) of the region in the destination image into which the source image should be
     *            decompressed/decoded
     *
     * @param y
     *            y offset (in pixels) of the region in the destination image into which the source image should be
     *            decompressed/decoded
     *
     * @param desiredWidth
     *            If the source image is a JPEG image, then this specifies the desired width (in pixels) of the
     *            decompressed image (or image region.) If the desired destination image dimensions are different than
     *            the source image dimensions, then TurboJPEG will use scaling in the JPEG decompressor to generate the
     *            largest possible image that will fit within the desired dimensions. Setting this to 0 is the same as
     *            setting it to the width of the JPEG image (in other words, the width will not be considered when
     *            determining the scaled image size.) This parameter is ignored if the source image is a YUV image.
     *
     * @param pitch
     *            bytes per line of the destination image. Normally, this should be set to
     *            <code>scaledWidth * TJ.pixelSize(pixelFormat)</code> if the destination image is unpadded, but you can
     *            use this to, for instance, pad each line of the destination image to a 4-byte boundary or to
     *            decompress/decode the source image into a region of a larger image. NOTE: if the source image is a
     *            JPEG image, then <code>scaledWidth</code> can be determined by calling <code>
     * scalingFactor.{@link TJScalingFactor#getScaled getScaled}(jpegWidth)
     * </code> or by calling {@link #getScaledWidth}. If the source image is a YUV image, then <code>scaledWidth</code>
     *            is the width of the YUV image. Setting this parameter to 0 is the equivalent of setting it to
     *            <code>scaledWidth * TJ.pixelSize(pixelFormat)</code>.
     *
     * @param desiredHeight
     *            If the source image is a JPEG image, then this specifies the desired height (in pixels) of the
     *            decompressed image (or image region.) If the desired destination image dimensions are different than
     *            the source image dimensions, then TurboJPEG will use scaling in the JPEG decompressor to generate the
     *            largest possible image that will fit within the desired dimensions. Setting this to 0 is the same as

     * @param pixelFormat
     *            pixel format of the decompressed/decoded image (one of {@link TJ#PF_RGB TJ.PF_*})
